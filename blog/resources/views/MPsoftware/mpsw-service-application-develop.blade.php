          Application modernization and Migration
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our application modernization and migration service helps in upgrading and developing a legacy system <br>
          Applications help an organization add value to the business by increasing efficiency and help concentrate on its core business. Applications have been around for a long time now, and a lot of them have become obsolete. However, most companies are doing the maximum amount of business transactions using these legacy applications. <br>
          As a CIO/CTO, you must be under immense pressure to provide maximum output with what you have. It might be difficult to run the business, keeping the cost low while supporting innovation with the existing application software. You are bound to add more resources in managing these legacy applications. New trends in technology adopted by your competitors only add to the overall pressure. <br>
          With MP Software’s Application Modernization services, a thorough analysis of your applications is done to the most basic level. Through our analysis, our experts will provide you with a detailed report about your applications - including our recommendations detailing which application to renew, re-code, retire, replace, re-platform, re-engineer, and re-architect. With this, you can reduce your costs and free up resources.

          Application Maintenance
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our experts manage critical applications and maximize growth opportunities and support service for a long time <br>
          Contrary to being an overhead cost, application management can turn out to be an advantage to your business. This will only happen with the right strategy and an innovative process.
        </p>
        <p>
          After spending a huge amount on developing custom applications, facing a downtime is the last thing your business needs. Moreover, about 15 to 20 percent of the cost of developing an application goes into maintaining the application software. It is, thus, eminent for enterprises to opt for the most cost-effective solution to support their applications.
          We, at MP Software, understand your needs and assist you with our Application Support and Maintenance (ASM) services. We provide constant maintenance and support while reducing cost through our onsite-offshore model. You get access to new functionalities and enhancements in your existing applications.</p>
        <p>Apart from providing some of the most sophisticated, business aligned and innovative software to our customers, we are equipped with the necessary experience and expertise to provide 24/7 support. Through our regular patches and systematic monitoring, you will never have to worry about application downtime.</p>

          Application integration
        </h3>
        <p>
          We streamline existing application architecture by embracing emerging technologies and deliver faster and cost effective enterprise solutions development services. <br>
          Over time, large companies have increased in intricacy, often resulting in rigid and fragile systems. To further complicate the situation, legacy applications make system interconnectivity across your business problematic. To preserve business agility in a world of mobile, API, and SaaS, and with data residing in multiple systems (e.g. legacy, new, cloud, etc.), enterprise integration is critical. Enterprise integration increases efficiency and enables better decision making by offering precise information at the right time. <br>
          Eliminating complex point-to-point integration allows businesses to stay in touch, and be innovative and competitive. Moreover, enterprise integration gives you the power to make better decisions. Having real-time, up-to-date information will grant you access to make well-informed and insightful decisions about your business. All you need is impeccable data from all your systems, services, and applications, that is available around the clock.
